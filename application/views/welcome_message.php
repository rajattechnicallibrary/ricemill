    <p>I'm happy to help clarify any questions you have about the privacy policy warning. There are three ways to address this issue:

1- If your app requests user data or makes sensitive permissions requests such as Phone, Accounts, Contacts, Camera, or Microphone, you'll need to add a valid privacy policy in two places: your app's Store Listing page (instructions below) and within your app.

2- As a second option, you can remove any requests for user data or sensitive permissions. For example, you would need to remove the potentially sensitive permissons from the manifest. You will not need to add a privacy policy if you remove these requests.

3- If you cannot complete steps 1 or 2, you'll need to unpublish the app from the Play Store. If your app is already unpublished, you donâ€™t need to take action unless you re-publish the app in the future.</p>
